    <h1>Cream Ice Cream</h1>
    <p style="color: #a62fe5">
     Ice cream is one of this world's many special treats that are part of everyday life. It can come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, as well as texture and flavor. I am here to introduce you to the world of happieness, and delight. The real world is depressing anyways.</p>
      
    <p style="color: #FFC0CB"> My favorite ice cream, is from a game called ‘kingdom hearts’. It is called <strong style= "color: #A5F2F3"> sea-salt ice cream</strong>  ,and can be made in real life. It's a icy blue color,and constantly refered to in the game, as “Salty, but sweet.” Seems a bit odd, but people who have made it say that it actually tastes pretty good.

    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 c. milk</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 t. vanilla</li>
      <li>1 c. heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>put in salt to taste/liking</li>
      <li>blue food coloring (optional)</li>
      <li>popsicle molds (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Directions:
      Separate the eggs into two good sized bowls and beat the egg whites until stiff. Mix the egg yolks and sugar until thick. Slowly bring milk to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Pour hot milk into yolk/sugar mixture, slowly, only a little at time, and mix well. Pour milk/yolk/sugar mixture back into pot and heat on medium until thicker to make a custard. Do not boil. Pour custard in with beaten egg whites and mix well. Add sea salt (keeping adding salt until it tastes salty sweet). Put mixture in fridge to cool. Once cool, add cream, vanilla and coloring to mixture. Freeze, following your ice cream maker’s instructions. If you wish, get some ice pop molds. Spray the inside of these with very little PAM spray (or something similar). Then pour the ice cream into the molds right after it comes out of the ice cream maker. Pop the lid on and the stick in and freeze for at least two hours.</p>
